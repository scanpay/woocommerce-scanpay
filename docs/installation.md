1. Ensure that you have **NOT** enabled *"Scanpay for WooCommerce"* before the configuration is completed.
2. Generate an API key in Scanpay's dashboard [here](https://dashboard.scanpay.dk/settings/api). Make sure to keep the API key private and secure.
3. Copy the key and return to the scanpay configuration page in the WordPress dashboard.
4. Insert your Scanpay API key in the *"API key"* field and click *"Save changes"*.
5. Click the *"Send ping"* button at the top of the configuration page. Click *"save"*, check validation and close the window. Scanpay's dashboard will automatically configure your ping URL.
6. You have now completed the installation and configuration of our WooCommerce plugin. Remember to enable *"Scanpay for Woocommerce"* when you are ready to accept payments through Scanpay. We recommend performing a test order to ensure that everything is working as intended.
