### Why choose Scanpay?

#### Acquirer agnostic

Scanpay is a neutral and acquirer-agnostic payment gateway with connections to several acquiring banks. With our platform, you can have multiple acquirers and easily add or remove an acquirer. This allows you to obtain the best prices in the market and acquirer failover _(redundancy)_.

#### Low pricing

We do not charge any setup, monthly or hidden fees. Our only fee is a transaction fee of 0.25 DKK (~ â‚¬0.034).

#### Security

Our platform is programmed in C and designed with a security-by-design approach, making security considerations the core of our engineering process. The emphasis has been on creating a secure, stable, efficient platform with a small and auditable codebase.

#### Performance

We believe we have created the most performant payment platform in the world. The platform is battle-tested and capable of handling millions of transactions. As engineers, this is something we are genuinely proud of.
